# Rafka

Rafka is a blazing-fast, experimental distributed asynchronous message broker written in Rust. Inspired by Apache Kafka, it stands out with its peer-to-peer mesh architecture and custom in-memory database for unparalleled scalability and low-latency performance. Leveraging a P2P mesh inspired by Pastry and Chord, Rafka ensures hyper-scalability and efficient message routing. Each broker node features a built-in in-memory "sidecar" database for storing frequently accessed data, minimizing storage trips and optimizing responses for repetitive queries. Metadata management uses a distributed hash table (DHT) model for fault tolerance and seamless coordination. Designed for Kubernetes-native deployment, Rafka dynamically scales, avoids single points of failure, and excels in modern distributed environments.

### Current Status: Early Development

This project is in active development and **Not ready for production use**.

## Overview

Rafka is a simple messaging system that allows producers to send messages to a broker, which then distributes them to consumers. The system is designed to be modular and extensible, with support for pluggable storage engines, hooks for custom logic, and configurable components.

This project serves as a learning tool for understanding how messaging systems work and how different components interact in a Rust-based application.

## Features

- **Broker Implementation**: Manages producers and consumers, dispatches messages, and integrates with storage engines and hooks.
- **Peer-Peer Mesh**: Creates a distributed layer around the system allowing for direct broker-broker communication in log(n) lookup time
- **Producers and Consumers**: Simple implementations that interact with the broker to send and receive messages.
- **Storage Engines**: Builtin In-memoryDB storage for persisting messages.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Uses asynchronous programming with Tokio for high performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install Rust (latest stable version recommended) from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Cargo**: Comes with Rust installation.

### Building the Project

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rafka.git
cd rafka
```

Build the project using Cargo:

```bash
cargo build
```

### Running the Application

Run the application with:

```bash
cargo run
```

This will execute the main.rs file, which sets up the broker, producer, and consumer, and demonstrates sending and receiving messages.

## Components

### Core

The rafka_core crate defines the core traits and interfaces used throughout the system, including:

- `Message`: Message Types and Handling.

### Broker

The `broker` crate contains the broker logic and handeling, topics and partition management.

### Producer

The `producer` crate provides the Producers, which buffers messages and sends them to the broker.

### Consumer

The `consumer` crate provides the Consumer, which subscribes to topics to receives messages from the broker.

### Storage

The `storage` crate provides implementations of storage engines:
